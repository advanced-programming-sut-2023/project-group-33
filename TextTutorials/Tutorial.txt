The program will start from Main Menu. You're either logged in from your previous login (by setting --stay-logged-in
flag at the end of login command) or you must log in which the program will open up login menu (read Login menu Tutorial).

Any field in commands can be given with a space but it must be inside quotation marks(""). It's important to know you must
close it or the command won't be read.
